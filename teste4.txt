Networks of sponges could capture DNA to track ocean health

To track the biological health of oceans, researchers use cameras, satellite images, and, increasingly, DNA shed directly into the water. But capturing genetic material in the sea is a tough task: Scientists must sift through massive amounts of water to dredge up their samples. Now, marine biologists have discovered that sponges are very good at “sponging” up DNA. More research is needed, but eventually a network of sponges planted throughout the oceans could provide an easy readout of how the diversity of plants and animals nearby is doing.

“It’s a clever idea,” says Eske Willeslev, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved with the work. “It could make studies of biodiversity easier and more consistent.”

Across the planet, biologists are scrambling to catalog all the world’s plants and animals before they disappear. Traditionally, that meant going out and collecting samples of every species. In the past 20 years, however, researchers have been collecting and sequencing DNA from soil, water, air, and even the guts of other organisms. This so-called environmental DNA, or eDNA, can tell what plants, animals, or microbes are present in a given environment.
